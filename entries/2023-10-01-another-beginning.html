        So I am actually starting a PhD. It feels like a mixture of over and underwhelming. When I hear people say they are studying a PhD, I imagine lab coats, experiments, and people far smarter than me. Instead I am just sat here, looking at research papers and writing notes. I wonder when the feeling will fully sink in, when will I feel like a PhD student?
      </p>
      <p>
        This is to be a reflection space rather than a place to post ABOUT my PhD. I want to write about the experience, so I won't be explaining my work, I will just be writing it as it comes. If what I include is technical, then it is written for me and not so that others can understand.
