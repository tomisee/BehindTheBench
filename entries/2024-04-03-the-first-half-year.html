        Feelings of inspiration, interspersed by imposter syndrome.

        Six months since having started the PhD. I finally understand the imposter syndrome effect. I am inspired to continue
        to write both my research and about my journey but the feelings of being an imposter ever creep into my mind.
        I understand the research, I am able to hold a conversation with people, but there is so little opportunity to talk to
        someone in my field that I feel like I am making it all up as I go along.

        Here is to another 6 months and onwards.
