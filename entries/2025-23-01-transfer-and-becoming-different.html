        I completed my transfer report and Viva today. I am proud to have gotten through with no corrections.
        A massive achievement to move from essentially what was a Masters of Philosophy track to the full PhD track.<br>
        <br>Like clockwork, the feeling of burnout and loss of direction hit hard as ever. I tend to get this when I finish a milestone in anything.
        Its as if my achievement would feel different, more inspiring maybe. Instead I am left with a feeling of emptiness, 
        which I usually solve by sulking and procrastinating.<br><br>
        I am going to look into this feeling, I need to develop a reliable means of resolving it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Regardless of my thoughts and feelings currently, I have now transferred onto the full PhD track. There is no going back now, it is sink or swim.
